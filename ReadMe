The ComputationalSolution.py is a python program that analyzes the clinical trial data based on certain end points to determine if the drugable stent has stastically reached none, one or both of the end points.

End points:
Endpoint #1 (Primary Endpoint): Achieve primary patency at 9 months
after treatment (DEF PATENCY: the condition of being open, expanded, or
unobstructed.) Primary patency is also defined as not needing a lesion
revascularization, and less than 60% stenosis measured by either duplex
ultrasonography or angiography.

Endpoint #2: Lowering of dystolic blood pressure by at least 10mmHg.
The idea here is that if the drugable stent clinical trial results indicate that
the above two endpoints have been met, then this is one critical step
toward obtaining FDA approval to commercialize, market, and sell the
drugable stent to potential patients.
